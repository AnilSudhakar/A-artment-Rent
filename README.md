# Apartment Rent Prediction Germany

# About

The data was scraped from Immoscout24, the biggest real estate platform in Germany. Immoscout24 has listings for both rental properties and homes for sale, however, the data only contains offers for rental properties.

# Content

The data set contains most of the important properties, such as living area size, the rent, both base rent as well as total rent (if applicable), the location (street and house number, if available, ZIP code and state), type of energy etc. It also has two variables containing longer free text descriptions: description with a text describing the offer and facilities describing all available facilities, newest renovation etc. The date column was added to give the time of scraping. But, for the sake of the app only six independent variables are considered.

# Aim
The aim of this project is to build a web app which gives the apartment rent in Germany.

Though the data is scrapped in 2019 the predicted rents are close to the current rent.
